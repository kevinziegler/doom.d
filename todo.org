* TODO Move "theme" selection into a git-ignored config file
- Main conf should only load this file if it exists
- Goal is to cut down on commits for "I got bored with $CURRENT_THEME"
- Other configs that should follow this pattern?
* TODO Setup merge-conflict resolution
- Figure out the magic I had back in Spacemacs, port/rebuild that here.

* Packages to consider adding to this configuration

https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda

** Groups to consider
- Retro discussion topics
- 1-1 discussion topics (broken down by person)
- Action items (TODOs not tracked in Jira)

* Set up Sprint/Iteration capture template
- Landing page for notes on sprint progress
- Outline for sprint ceremonies
- Land questions/discovered information in that sprint
- Track new work identified during that sprint

** Additional capture templates for per-sprint notes
- e.g. Create a retro topic for the upcoming retro
- Capture ticket that needs definition
- Capture a question that came up as part of a sprint
- Capture tech-debt work
  + Give context to when I discover an issue
  + Tag items as ~tech-debt~ for consolidated view outside of per-sprint file

** Roll-over open TODO items from previous sprint
- e.g. Action items from retro

* Org Mode Snippet for setting up DB connection in org-babel scripts
- input host/user/db
** How to manage passwords?
- netrc?
- pgpass?

* Capture template for this TODO file

* Setup deadgrep/give it a test drive
https://github.com/Wilfred/deadgrep

* Improve roam capture popup
- Full screen if on dashboard/scratch

* Sprint management via Org Notes

** Use Cases
*** Current Sprint

**** Capture an action item coming out of retro discussions
**** Make note of something to demo at the end of the sprint
*** Next Sprint
**** Note a ticket/TODO item to address as part of planning for the next sprint
**** Rollover of action items from previous sprints
**** Track a TODO item for the next sprint

* Set up Hard-coded Bookmarks for common Config Files
- gitconfig (global and machine-local)
- zsh config (global and machine local)
- Global gitignore
- Doom TODOs (This file)
- Dotfiles TODOs
