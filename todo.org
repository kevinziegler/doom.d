* TODO Move "theme" selection into a git-ignored config file
- Main conf should only load this file if it exists
- Goal is to cut down on commits for "I got bored with $CURRENT_THEME"
- Other configs that should follow this pattern?
* TODO Org-Capture template for 1-1 topics
- Org-Roam based?
* TODO Setup merge-conflict resolution
- Figure out the magic I had back in Spacemacs, port/rebuild that here.

* Packages to consider adding to this configuration
